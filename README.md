# OPNsense Device Monitor

**[🇨🇿 Czech version](README_CZ.md)** | **[👨‍💻 More projects by the author](https://github.com/hacesoft?tab=repositories)**

---

Plugin for automatic network device monitoring in OPNsense firewall. Detects new devices on the network using the native OPNsense hostwatch database and sends email or webhook notifications.

> **AI disclaimer.** Parts of this fork, including the packaging and some
> features, were written with AI assistance and reviewed by a human before
> release. It runs on a firewall, so treat it as you would any third-party
> plugin: read the code, test it somewhere you can afford to break, and report
> anything that looks wrong.

## Version history

### v2.3 (August 2026) — Direct SMTP and notification improvements

- Added selectable **Email delivery method** in Device Monitor settings.
- **Local Sendmail / Postfix** remains the default and preserves existing installations.
- Added built-in **Direct SMTP** delivery using Python `smtplib`; no additional Python package is required.
- Direct SMTP supports **STARTTLS**, **SSL/TLS**, and unencrypted SMTP.
- Added SMTP server, port, username and password configuration to the UI.
- **Test Email** now uses the currently selected delivery method.
- Existing configuration files are merged with new defaults automatically, so upgrading does not require a configuration reset.
- SMTP credentials are read from the protected Device Monitor configuration instead of being passed on the process command line.
- Configuration containing SMTP credentials is stored with restrictive file permissions.
- Includes the v2.2 Hostwatch fixes: newest Hostwatch record is selected per MAC, deleted devices no longer return from historical records, VLAN notification filtering was corrected, and real Hostwatch `last_seen` values are preserved during quick status updates.

v2.1 (April 2026) — Dnsmasq hostname support
What changed and why
1. Dnsmasq hostname resolution — `get_dnsmasq_descriptions()`
OPNsense users who migrated from the deprecated ISC DHCPv4 to Dnsmasq DNS & DHCP (the recommended replacement as of OPNsense 25.7+) had empty hostnames in Device Monitor. The previous code only read hostnames from `config.xml → dhcpd` (ISC DHCP static mappings).
A new function reads hostname data from the Dnsmasq Host Overrides section of `config.xml`. The correct XML structure for Dnsmasq entries is:
```xml
<hosts uuid="...">
  <host>MyDevice</host>          ← hostname field
  <hwaddr>aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff</hwaddr>  ← MAC address (note: hwaddr, NOT hw)
  <ip>192.168.1.100</ip>
  <descr>My Device Description</descr>
</hosts>
```
> ⚠️ The MAC address field is `<hwaddr>` — not `<hw>` as one might expect. This was confirmed by inspecting a live `config.xml`.
2. ISC DHCP disabled interfaces are now skipped
When an ISC DHCP interface is disabled (checkbox unchecked in the UI), OPNsense sets no `<enable>` child element inside that interface's config block. The updated `get_dhcp_descriptions()` function skips any ISC interface that lacks the `<enable>` tag, preventing stale data from disabled interfaces from appearing as hostnames.
3. Hostname source priority
Hostname resolution now follows a clear priority chain:
```
1. custom_hostname  (manually set in Device Monitor UI — highest priority)
2. Dnsmasq          (Host Overrides with MAC → hostname mapping)
3. ISC DHCP         (static mappings, hostname field preferred over descr)
```
Dnsmasq overwrites ISC data for the same MAC address via `dict.update()`:
```python
dhcp_descriptions = get_dhcp_descriptions()     # ISC DHCP (enabled interfaces only)
dnsmasq_descriptions = get_dnsmasq_descriptions()  # Dnsmasq Host Overrides
dhcp_descriptions.update(dnsmasq_descriptions)  # Dnsmasq wins on conflict
```
4. Hostname field preference within ISC DHCP
Previously, the ISC DHCP reader used only `<descr>` (the description/note field). It now prefers `<hostname>` and falls back to `<descr>` only when `<hostname>` is absent or empty. This matches how hostnames actually appear in DNS and DHCP lease tables.


### v2.0 (April 2026) — Major overhaul

This version is a complete architectural rewrite focused on deep integration with OPNsense 26.x. Many components that were previously custom-built are now replaced by native OPNsense mechanisms.

#### What changed and why

**1. Service registration — `plugins.inc.d/devicemonitor.inc`**

In previous versions, the daemon was completely invisible to OPNsense. It did not appear in *System → Diagnostics → Services*, so there was no way to start/stop/restart it from the GUI.

The fix is a new file `src/etc/inc/plugins.inc.d/devicemonitor.inc` which registers the service using OPNsense's native `plugins_services()` mechanism.

```php
function devicemonitor_services()
{
    $services = [];
    $services[] = [
        'description' => gettext('Device Monitor - network device tracking'),
        'configd' => [
            'restart' => ['devicemonitor restart'],
            'start'   => ['devicemonitor start'],
            'stop'    => ['devicemonitor stop'],
        ],
        'name'    => 'devicemonitor',
        'pidfile' => '/var/run/devicemonitor.pid',
    ];
    return $services;
}
```

**2. Daemon status check — `daemon_status.sh`**

The previous approach used `service devicemonitor status` in the configd `[status]` action. On FreeBSD, this command returns exit code 1 even when the service is running normally (it returns 1 = "not managed by rc.d in the traditional sense"). Because configd type `script_output` treats any non-zero exit as an error, every status check produced `Execute error`.

The fix is a dedicated shell script that checks the pidfile directly:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
PIDFILE="/var/run/devicemonitor.pid"
if [ -f "$PIDFILE" ]; then
    PID=$(cat "$PIDFILE")
    if kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "running"
        exit 0
    fi
    rm -f "$PIDFILE"   # stale pidfile cleanup
fi
echo "stopped"
exit 0
```

**3. `actions_devicemonitor.conf` — `|| true` on start/stop/restart**

Without `|| true`, if the daemon was already running and configd tried to start it again, `service devicemonitor start` returned a non-zero exit code (daemon already running), which configd interpreted as an error and showed `Error (1)`. Adding `|| true` ensures configd always sees success.

The `[status]` action now calls `daemon_status.sh` instead of `service devicemonitor status`.

**4. `rc.d/devicemonitor` — added `procname`, fixed default**

Two fixes:
- Default changed from `"YES"` to `"NO"` — FreeBSD convention: the script itself must default to disabled; activation is done by `/etc/rc.conf.d/devicemonitor`
- Added `procname="/usr/local/bin/python3"` — without this, `rc.d` cannot find the running process and every `start` creates a new zombie process. 

**5. `service.xml` — fixed tag name, added `<pidfile>`, fixed `<commands>`**

Three bugs in one file:
- `<n>DeviceMonitor</n>` → `<name>DeviceMonitor</name>` — OPNsense did not recognize the `<n>` tag
- Added `<pidfile>/var/run/devicemonitor.pid</pidfile>` — needed for the green/red status dot
- `<commands>` changed from shell commands (`service devicemonitor start`) to configd action names (`devicemonitor start`)

**6. `ServiceController.php` — start/stop/restart via `configdRun()`**

Previously, the PHP API controller called `exec('service devicemonitor start')` directly. This bypasses OPNsense's privilege model. All service control now goes through `$backend->configdRun('devicemonitor start')`.

**7. Dashboard widget — fixed detached DOM issue**

The widget's `onWidgetTick()` method was updating `this.$container.find('.dm-total')`. However, OPNsense's widget framework copies the markup into the DOM rather than inserting the original jQuery object, so `this.$container` pointed to a detached element — `.find()` worked silently but changes were never visible on screen.

Fixed by giving each element a unique `id` and selecting directly from the document:

```javascript
// Before (broken — updates detached element)
this.$container.find('.dm-total').text(stats.total);

// After (correct — selects from live DOM)
$('#dm-total').text(stats.total);
```

Also fixed: the widget was calling `/api/devicemonitor/service/status` for device counts (which returns daemon status, not stats). It now correctly calls `/api/devicemonitor/devices/stats`.

**8. `install.sh` — complete rewrite**

Key changes:
- Zombie process cleanup before daemon start (`pkill -f monitor_daemon.py`)
- Daemon started via `configctl devicemonitor start` instead of `service devicemonitor start`
- Daemon verified via pidfile + `kill -0` instead of `service devicemonitor status`
- Removed broken `service php-fpm restart` and `configctl webgui restart` calls
- Added `plugins.inc.d/devicemonitor.inc` installation step
- Fixed step numbering (was `[6/11]` followed by `[6/10]`)

**9. `uninstall.sh` — fixed daemon stop**

Previously used `service devicemonitor status` which returned exit 1, causing the stop to fail. Now uses `pkill -f monitor_daemon.py` which always works regardless of pidfile state.

Also removed broken `configctl webgui restart` and `service php-fpm restart` calls — these are either not available or unnecessary on OPNsense 26.x.

---

### v1.x (January 2026)

- **OPNsense 26.x compatibility fix:** Removed `$this->sessionClose()` calls from controllers. This function was removed in OPNsense 26.0 and caused crashes when called. Added automatic version detection to maintain backward compatibility with 25.x.

---

---

## Requirements

- **OPNsense 26.1.5 or newer**
- **SSH access** (System → Settings → Administration → Secure Shell)
- **Root account** or admin with CLI access

> ⚠️ Versions prior to 26.1.5 are not supported. The plugin uses APIs and mechanisms introduced in 26.x.

---

## Installation

### Method 1: Plugin repository (recommended)

Installs Device Monitor as a real OPNsense plugin, visible under **System → Firmware → Plugins**, with updates handled by the firmware updater.

**Step 1:** Add the repository once, as root over SSH:
```bash
fetch -o /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/mxy-opnsense-repo.conf https://maxysoft.github.io/opnsense-repo/mxy-opnsense-repo.conf
pkg update
```

**Step 2:** Install it — in the GUI under **System → Firmware → Plugins**, search for `os-devicemonitor` and press **+**. Or from the shell:
```bash
pkg install os-devicemonitor
```

Update with `pkg upgrade os-devicemonitor` or from **System → Firmware → Updates**. Remove with `pkg remove os-devicemonitor`; the device database in `/var/db/devicemonitor` is kept.

> Already installed via `install.sh`? Run `sh uninstall.sh` first (it preserves the database), then install the package. Otherwise the old, unmanaged copies of the files stay behind and `pkg remove` will not clean them up.

Repository source: [maxysoft/opnsense-repo](https://github.com/maxysoft/opnsense-repo)

---

### Method 2: WinSCP + SSH

**Step 1:** Download the latest release ZIP from [Release](../../tree/main/release).

**Step 2:** Enable SSH on OPNsense:
```
System → Settings → Administration → Secure Shell → Enable
```

**Step 3:** Upload via WinSCP to `/tmp/` on OPNsense.

**Step 4:** Connect via SSH and install:
```bash
cd /tmp
unzip opnsense-devicemonitor*.zip
cd opnsense-devicemonitor
sh install.sh
```

No reboot required. The install script handles everything.

---

### Method 3: Direct SSH

```bash
ssh root@your.opnsense.ip
cd /tmp
fetch https://github.com/maxysoft/opnsense-devicemonitor/releases/latest/download/opnsense-devicemonitor.zip
unzip opnsense-devicemonitor.zip
cd opnsense-devicemonitor
sh install.sh
```

---

### What install.sh does

1. Checks OPNsense version (minimum 26.1.5)
2. Runs `uninstall.sh --silent` if an old installation is detected (preserves database)
3. Creates all required directories
4. Copies RC script and registers the service in `plugins.inc.d`
5. Installs the dashboard widget
6. Compiles translation files
7. Copies MVC controllers, models, views
8. Copies Python, shell, and PHP scripts
9. Copies configd actions
10. Kills any zombie daemon processes, starts fresh via `configctl devicemonitor start`

---

## Configuration

Go to: **Services → DeviceMonitor → Settings**

### Basic

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable Device Monitor | Enable/disable scanning |
| Scan Interval | How often to scan (5–30 minutes) |

### Email notifications

Device Monitor offers two independent email delivery methods:

- **Local Sendmail / Postfix** — the default and backward-compatible method. It uses `/usr/local/sbin/sendmail`, so a working local mail transport such as the OPNsense `os-postfix` plugin must be configured.
- **Direct SMTP (built into Device Monitor)** — connects directly to the configured SMTP server using Python `smtplib`, without requiring Postfix or Monit for message delivery.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable Email | Enable email notifications |
| Email (To) | Recipient address |
| Email (From) | Sender address |
| Email delivery method | Select Local Sendmail/Postfix or Direct SMTP |
| SMTP Server | SMTP hostname or IP address (Direct SMTP only) |
| SMTP Port | SMTP port, typically 587 for STARTTLS or 465 for SSL/TLS |
| Encryption | STARTTLS, SSL/TLS, or None |
| SMTP Username | Optional SMTP authentication username |
| SMTP Password | Optional SMTP authentication password |
| Test Email | Save the current settings and test the selected delivery method |

Existing installations continue to use **Local Sendmail / Postfix** after upgrading unless Direct SMTP is explicitly selected.

### Webhook notifications

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable Webhook | Enable webhook notifications |
| Webhook URL | Target URL |
| Test Webhook | Send a test payload |

**Supported webhook types:**

- **ntfy.sh** — `https://ntfy.sh/yourSecretTopic`
- **Discord** — `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...`
- **Generic** — any HTTP POST endpoint receiving JSON

---

## Usage

### Lobby dashboard widget

After installation, add the **Device Monitor** widget to the Lobby dashboard. It shows:
- Daemon status (Running / Stopped)
- Total device count
- Online device count

### Device list

**Services → DeviceMonitor → Devices**

Columns: MAC, Vendor, IP, Hostname, First Seen, Last Seen, Actions

### Service control

**System → Diagnostics → Services → devicemonitor**

Start, stop, restart the daemon directly from the GUI. The green/red status dot reflects the actual process state via pidfile.

### Logs

```bash
# Live log
tail -f /var/log/devicemonitor.log

# Filter by type
grep EMAIL /var/log/devicemonitor.log
grep WEBHOOK /var/log/devicemonitor.log
grep SCAN /var/log/devicemonitor.log
```

```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin does not appear in Services

```bash
# Verify the .inc file exists (NOT .php!)
ls /usr/local/etc/inc/plugins.inc.d/devicemonitor.inc

# Verify PHP can load the function
php -r "require_once('/usr/local/etc/inc/plugins.inc.d/devicemonitor.inc'); var_dump(devicemonitor_services());"

# Reload plugin registry
/usr/local/etc/rc.configure_plugins
```

### Daemon control shows "Execute error"

```bash
# Check that daemon_status.sh exists and is executable
ls -la /usr/local/opnsense/scripts/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor/daemon_status.sh

# Test it manually (must print "running" or "stopped", never an error)
sh /usr/local/opnsense/scripts/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor/daemon_status.sh

# Check configd actions are loaded
configctl configd actions | grep devicemonitor
```

### Multiple zombie daemon processes

```bash
# Check how many are running
ps aux | grep monitor_daemon | grep -v grep

# Kill all instances
pkill -f monitor_daemon.py
rm -f /var/run/devicemonitor.pid

# Start fresh
configctl devicemonitor start
```

Root cause: the RC script was missing `procname`, so `rc.d` could not detect the running process and started a new one every time. Fixed in v2.0 by adding `procname="/usr/local/bin/python3"` to the RC script.

### Widget shows dashes, no data

```bash
# Verify the stats endpoint works
curl -k -u "APIKEY:APISECRET" https://localhost/api/devicemonitor/devices/stats
# Should return: {"total": N, "online": N}

# Verify the status endpoint works
curl -k -u "APIKEY:APISECRET" https://localhost/api/devicemonitor/service/status
# Should return: {"result": "running", ...}
```

If the endpoints return data but the widget still shows dashes, clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R) and check the browser console for JavaScript errors.

### Email notifications not working

```bash
# Test from command line
php /usr/local/opnsense/scripts/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor/notify_email.php

# Check logs
grep EMAIL /var/log/devicemonitor.log
```

### Daemon won't start

```bash
# Check log for startup errors
tail -30 /var/log/devicemonitor.log

# Run daemon manually to see errors
/usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/opnsense/scripts/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor/monitor_daemon.py

# Check that defaults.json is readable
cat /usr/local/opnsense/mvc/app/models/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor/defaults.json
```

### Corrupted database

```bash
cp /var/db/devicemonitor/devices.db /var/db/devicemonitor/devices.db.backup
rm /var/db/devicemonitor/devices.db
configctl devicemonitor restart
```

---

## Uninstallation

### Method 1: uninstall.sh (recommended)

```bash
cd /path/to/opnsense-devicemonitor
sh uninstall.sh
```

This removes all files, stops the daemon, disables autostart, and clears caches. The database `/var/db/devicemonitor/devices.db` is deleted.

### Method 2: Silent uninstall (preserves database)

```bash
sh uninstall.sh --silent
```

Used internally by `install.sh` during upgrades. Removes all files but keeps the database.

### Method 3: Manual

```bash
pkill -f monitor_daemon.py
rm -f /var/run/devicemonitor.pid
rm -f /etc/rc.conf.d/devicemonitor
rm -f /usr/local/etc/rc.d/devicemonitor
rm -f /etc/rc.d/devicemonitor
rm -f /usr/local/etc/inc/plugins.inc.d/devicemonitor.inc
rm -rf /usr/local/opnsense/mvc/app/controllers/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor
rm -rf /usr/local/opnsense/mvc/app/models/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor
rm -rf /usr/local/opnsense/mvc/app/views/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor
rm -rf /usr/local/opnsense/scripts/OPNsense/DeviceMonitor

rm -f /usr/local/opnsense/www/js/widgets/DeviceMonitor.js
rm -f /usr/local/opnsense/www/js/widgets/Metadata/DeviceMonitor.xml
rm -rf /var/db/devicemonitor        # WARNING: deletes device database
rm -f /var/log/devicemonitor.log
/usr/local/etc/rc.configure_plugins
service configd restart
```
